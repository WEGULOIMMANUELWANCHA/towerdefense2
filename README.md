Web Tower Defense
===

A little experiment in [WebGL] and [THREE.js].

Play the [demo]! Note: your browser must have WebGL enabled to play.

### Features

* Animated 3D models (OpenCollada)
* Particle explosion animations
* Uses the HTML5 Audio API for awesome sound effects
* Adjustable game speed

###### Note: This was my first project using JavaScript, so the code does not follow best practices. It is largely experimental (e.g. the focus is on features rather than balance or playability)
